#Shopback CLI

Assumptions:

* database is not configured due to time limits set myself for the assignment
* eslint is configured `npm run eslint`
* unit test files are next to module files `npm run utest`
* high level functional test are at ./test `npm run ftest`
* in case of external resource (databases) functional test should be run in docker env.
